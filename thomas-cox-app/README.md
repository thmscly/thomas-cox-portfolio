This is a website built by Thomas "T.C." Cox, a full-stack web developer.

It's my portfolio site and it was built using the following technologies:

<ul>
<li>Laravel 9</li>
<li>React</li>
<li>InertiaJS</li>
<li>Docker</li>
</ul>

It was built by following Laravel's robust <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/9.x" target="_blank">documentation</a>, specifically via the Breeze/React <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/starter-kits#breeze-and-inertia" target="_blank">starter kit</a>, which uses the <a href="https://inertiajs.com/" target="_blank">InertiaJS</a> scaffolding system to fuse the frontend/backend aspects of the web app.

The directory structure is quite extensive.

All of the routing can be found in routing/web.php.

All of the pages can be found in resources/js/Pages.

It's currently being deployed through Netlify.
